# Memeory

A memory-game played with gifs instead of images. Players can choose any theme they can think of (eg. cats, flowers, cars) and get gifs according to their chosen theme.

**Work-in-progress alpha version**

Plans/fixes for future versions:
* Multiple difficulty settings
* Improve styling
* ... and more

1. Familiarize myself React with a very interactive project
2. Deepen my knowledge of how to combine React with the asynchronous nature of external APIs
3. Learn Unit Testing and TDD with Jest and Enzyme
